# The Badhouse Ventures Manifesto

Our VC firm, focused on investing and providing hands-on startup operator support to very early-stage ventures, will have two main "customers": Startup founders and next-round investors. This manifesto outlines our intentions to provide value to both of these groups.

## 1. For startup founders
* We will be getting our hands dirty alongside the startup founders. This may include:
  * technical advice, such as technical architecture, sourcing compute power, acting as beta testers, etc.
  * client-facing interactions, such as assisting with technical support, collecting feedback, making connections to get first clients, etc.
  * being a recruiter
  * assisting with business and financial modeling 
  * sourcing legal support
  * making investor introductions and helping to refine the investment pitch
* We will endeavour to help startup founders focus on building; technical building, but also building a user base and business development.
* Progress will be measured by:
  * cycling through build-test-learn cycles
  * refining what product-market fit looks like and working towards it
  * getting more active users and getting paying customers
  * building relationships with potential next-round investors
* We will be investing funds into the business in return for a fair amount of equity.

## 2. For next-round investors
* We will facilitate your deal flow by introducing you to vetted, higher-quality startups that are ready for a seed investment rounnd because they will have:
  * a more mature product
  * more evidence of traction, more data points 
  * a team with more experience under their belt
  * a lower risk profile (past an inflection point in profitability, more users, a first B2B or enterprise client, etc.)
