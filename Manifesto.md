# The Badhouse Ventures Manifesto

The incubator-studio (i.e., pre-seed VC investing and providing hands-on startup operator support) will have two main "customers": Startup founders and next-round investors. This manifesto outlines our intentions to provide value to both of these groups.

## 1. For startup founders

* We will be getting our hands dirty alongside the startup founders. This may include:
  * technical work, such as technical architecture, sourcing compute power, doing website development, acting as beta testers, etc.
  * client-facing work, such as assisting with technical support, making connections to get first clients, etc.
  * being a recruiter
  * contributing to administrative tasks
  * providing or sourcing legal support (including incorporation, if necessary)
  * making introductions and pitching to investors together with the founders
* Typical accelerators and incubators keep founders busy all the time, but the wrong kind of busy. We will endeavour to make it so that startup founders can focus on building; technical building, but also building a user base and business development.
* Progress will be measured by:
  * cycling through build-test-learn cycles
  * refining what product-market fit looks like and working towards it
  * getting more active users and getting paying customers
  * building relationships with potential next-round investors
* We will be investing funds into the business in return for a fair amount of equity.

## 2. For next-round investors
* We will facilitate your deal flow by introducing you to vetted, higher-quality startups that are ready for seed(+) investment because they will have:
  * a more mature product
  * a team with more experience under their belt
  * a lower risk profile (past an inflection point in profitability, more users, a first B2B or enterprise client, etc.)
